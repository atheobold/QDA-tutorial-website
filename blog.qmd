# Welcome!

My intention for this website is to provide a step-by-step resource for how one
qualitatively analyzes computing code, so you (!) can draw on this work to
research the teaching and learning of data science in new ways. Qualitative
coding in data science is a building block that can lead to more extensive
research going forward including conceptualize student learning and
growth and understanding learning environments that promote growth. 

## Structure of Tutorial

The pages of this website correspond to different aspects of the analysis
process as pictured above. 

1. I discuss how one selects a unit of analysis
2. I outline how descriptive codes are created
3. I walk through how codes can be collapsed into emergent themes
4. I describe how student interviews allowed me to dig deeper into the themes
that emerged
5. I talk through how to make comparisons across individual's themes
