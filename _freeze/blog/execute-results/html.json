Qualitative\ncoding in data science is a building block that can lead to more extensive\nresearch going forward including conceptualize student learning and\ngrowth and understanding learning environments that promote growth. \n\n## Structure of Tutorial\n\nThe pages of this website correspond to different aspects of the analysis\nprocess as pictured above. \n\n1. I discuss how one selects a unit of analysis\n2. I outline how descriptive codes are created\n3. I walk through how codes can be collapsed into emergent themes\n4. I describe how student interviews allowed me to dig deeper into the themes\nthat emerged\n5. I talk through how to make comparisons across individual's themes\n\n",
