### Workflow

<!-- How code comments were used between the two students -->
<!-- How objects were inspected in the code vs. in the console -->

::: {.column-margin}
![](images/workflow.png)
:::

```{r}
students %>% 
  filter(theme_note == "workflow") %>%
  distinct(code, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  select(code, descriptive_code) %>% 
  datatable(class = 'row-border stripe', 
            colnames = c("R Code", "Descriptive Code")
            )

```


### Efficiency / Inefficiency

<!-- Repeated tasks differences between students -->

::: {.column-margin}
![](images/efficient.png)
:::

```{r}
students %>% 
  filter(theme_note %in% c("inefficiency", "efficiency")) %>%
  distinct(code, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  select(code, descriptive_code) %>% 
  datatable(class = 'row-border stripe', 
            colnames = c("R Code", "Descriptive Code")
            )
```



### Readability 

<!-- Use of whitespace around delimiters, named arguments, new lines for long code  -->

::: {.column-margin}
![](images/read.png)
:::

### Reproducibility

<!-- No data loading code in Student A -->
<!-- Student A had code that wouldn't run (required a package be loaded but wasn't until later, reference to non-existant objects) -->

<!-- Student B had all used functions / data sourced in to R script -->
<!-- Still, the project would be difficult to share as there was a mix of full paths -->
<!-- and relative paths which another user would need to modify -->
<!-- Keep in mind RStudio projects were not a thing when these students were completing their project -->
